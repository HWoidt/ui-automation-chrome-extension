# UI Automation Chrome Extension
When it comes to writing end-to-end tests, developers lose a lot of time writing boilerplate code. UI Automation Chrome Extension aims to address this problem by speeding up the process of writing automated Selenium tests. It provides simple DOM selectors with Java code snippets so that developers can reduce repetitive boilerplate-writing and focus on test logic instead.

Here’s what UI Automation Chrome Extension does:

- generates XPath and CSS selectors for selected elements in the Elements tab of Chrome’s Developer Tools.
- provides Java code samples to help you to write Selenium tests for your web application.

The extension is designed with simplicity in mind. It’s meant to be intuitive so you can start using it right away without reading any manuals.

Google already has a feature to get XPath and CSS selectors for a selected element. However, this tool does a better job keeping the selectors as simple as possible. For now, only CSS is optimized to use as short selectors as possible.

Examples of CSS selectors generated by UI automation vs Chrome:

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) search field:

    input[name='q']
    #hnmain > tbody > tr:nth-child(4) > td > center:nth-child(6) > form > input[type="text"]

[Google](https://www.google.de) search button:

    input[name='btnK']
    #tsf > div.tsf-p > div.jsb > center > input[type="submit"]:nth-child(1)

### Other Links
